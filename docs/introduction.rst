Introduction
============

The CLiC web app\ `[1] <footnotes.html>`__ has been developed
as part of the CLiC Dickens
project\ `[2] <footnotes.html>`__, which demonstrates
through corpus stylistics how computer-assisted methods can be used to
study literary texts and lead to new insights into how readers perceive
fictional characters. CLiC Dickens started at the University of
Nottingham in 2013; it is now a collaborative project with the
University of Birmingham.

*The CLiC Dickens project is funded by the Arts and Humanities Research
Council, grant reference AH/P504634/1.*

*Project team: Prof. Michaela Mahlberg, Prof. Peter Stockwell, Viola
