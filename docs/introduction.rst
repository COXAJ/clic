Introduction
============

The CLiC web app (http://clic.bham.ac.uk) has been developed
as part of the CLiC Dickens
project (see [CLiC_project_page]_), which demonstrates
through corpus stylistics how computer-assisted methods can be used to
study literary texts and lead to new insights into how readers perceive
fictional characters. CLiC Dickens started at the University of
Nottingham in 2013; it is now a collaborative project hosted at the
University of Birmingham.
