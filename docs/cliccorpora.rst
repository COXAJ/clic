The CLiC corpora
================

The CLiC homepage, part of which is shown in
Figure, acts as a table of contents for all
the books and their chapters; when clicking onto any of the chapter
links you are taken to the full text of that section. As of version
1.6.1, released in November 2017, CLiC contains 138 texts, mainly from
the 19th century; for a full list of titles please refer to Appendix 1.
The procedure followed for retrieving, cleaning and importing the most
recent texts is described in detail on our GitHub
repository\ `[5] <footnotes.html>`__. The texts can be
selected individually and combined freely for analysis in any of the
CLiC tools\ `[6] <footnotes.html>`__. You can also choose from
one of our four pre-selected corpora: DNov – Dickens's Novels (15
texts), 19C – 19th Century Reference Corpus (29 texts), ChiLit – 19th
Century Children's Literature Corpus (71 texts) and ArTs –Additional
Requested Texts (23 texts). ArTs includes additional GCSE and A-Level
titles (please see Appendix 2 for an overview of all CLiC texts listed
in the AQA, OCR and Edexcel GCSE and A-Level English specifications).

In order to **select texts** in any of the CLiC analysis tabs, go to
control bar on the right-hand side (circled in
Figure above). You can select any or all of
the texts by picking the corpora from a drop-down list or typing their
names into a textbox. For example, in the Concordance tool, once you
have clicked on the Concordance tab, a textbox labeled **'Search the
corpora'** will appear (for more information on the Concordance tab, see
Section 5.2), as illustrated in Figure.

   **Figure:** Selecting corpora in the Concordance tab (same procedure
   in Subsets and Clusters; for Keywords see Section 5.5)

You can select the pre-selected corpora in their entirety or you can
pick individual books from them, effectively creating your own
subcorpus. For example, you could select several books from Dickens,
several books from the 19th Century Reference Corpus (19C) and several
books from the 19th Century Children's Literature Corpus (ChiLit). You
could also create an author-based corpus, for example by selecting all
of Jane Austen's novels by typing *austen* into the textbox (which is
not case-sensitive); this will pull out the relevant novels from any of
the corpora for individual selection (see
Figure).

The CLiC corpora have been marked up to distinguish between several
textual subsets of novels. Example
from Great Expectations below illustrates the subsets and
Figure shows how these are marked up
in the chapter views, which can be retrieved from the 'in bk.' (in book)
button in concordances (see Section 5.2) and the table of contents on
the homepage.

   "And on what evidence, Pip," asked Mr. Jaggers, very coolly, as he
   paused with his handkerchief half way to his nose,"does Provis make
   this claim?”

   "He does not make it," said I, "and has never made it, and has no
   knowledge or belief that his daughter is in existence.”

   For once, the powerful pocket-handkerchief failed. My reply was so
   unexpected that Mr. Jaggers put the handkerchief back into his pocket
   without completing the usual performance, folded his arms, and looked
   with stern attention at me, though with an immovable face.

   *[Great Expectations, Chapter 51]*

-  quotes: any text listed in quotes, i.e. mostly character speech but
   also thoughts or songs that might appear in quotes
-  non-quotes: narration

   -  and a special case of non-quotes, suspensions, which represent
      narratorial interruptions of character speech that do not end with
      sentence-final punctuation. Suspensions are further divided by
      length:

      -  short suspensions have a length up to four words
      -  long suspensions have a length of five or more words

A more detailed discussion of the subsets in CLiC – and the rationale
behind this division – can be found in the open access article by
Mahlberg et al. (2016)`[7] <footnotes.html>`__.
