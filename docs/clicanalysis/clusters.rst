Clusters
========

The output of the cluster tool generates frequency lists of single words
and 'clusters' (repeated sequences of words). Clusters are also called
'n-grams', where 'n' stands for the length of the phrase. If we choose a
'1-gram' (single word), we retrieve a simple word list. (In *Oliver
Twist*, for example, the top 10 words retrieved from this tool are *the,
and, to, of, a, he, in, his, that* â€“ all function words, as we would
generally expect.) From version 2.0 onwards, CLiC supports clusters of length
1 (single words) up to 7 (`i am very much obliged to you`), as illustrated in :numref:`figure-analysis-clusters-ngrams`

   Cluster options

As in the other tabs, you can restrict the search to a particular subset
(**'Only in subsets: Select an Option'**) so that, for example, you can create frequency
lists for clusters in quotes (or any of the other subsets). You can save
the resulting list as a CSV file (for example for use in a spreadsheet
viewer) by clicking the **'Save'** button at the top. Note that the CLiC
'Cluster' tab will display words and clusters with a minimum frequency
of 5.
