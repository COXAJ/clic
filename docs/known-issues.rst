List of known issues
====================

We are aware of the following issues and will try to fix them in future versions of CLiC.
If you notice anything else, please let us know via email at `clic@contacts.bham.ac.uk <mailto:clic@contacts.bham.ac.uk>`_

* `LD` (Little Dorrit): the `text <https://github.com/birmingham-ccr/corpora/blob/master/DNov/LD.txt>`_ is missing the title of its first part, which should read "BOOK THE FIRST POVERTY" (to match "BOOK THE SECOND RICHES" at the beginning of the second part - and both should be highlighted as parts)
* The author for `jackapanes` (*Jackapanes*) and `overtheway` (*Mrs. Overtheway's Remembrances*) should be identical. The books are currently listed under two different authors: 1. Juliana Horatio Ewing and 2. Juliana Horatia Ewing. Whilst the first spelling, used in `jackapanes`, appears to be wrong (see the `Wikipedia entry<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juliana_Horatia_Ewing>`_), it is the spelling that used in the initial version of the text `downloaded from Gutenberg <https://github.com/birmingham-ccr/corpora/blob/a020b2a7153baf8849056be833861ecb3d77e7a1/ChiLit/jackanapes.txt>`_. It should still be adjusted to end in "a" so that the selection of Ewing's books shows both `jackapanes` and `overtheway` rather than listing two different entries for Ewings.
