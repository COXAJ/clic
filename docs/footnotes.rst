   of this guide: Jamie Lentin, Anna Cermakova and Lorenzo Mastropierro.
   Yet, given the new interface, this user guide is still a work in
   progress. Please get in touch via clic@contacts.birmingham.ac.uk if
   you have further questions or suggestions for improvement. `[Go] <whatsnew.html>`__

#. Please note that we do not recommend selecting all CLiC texts at
   once, because the tool will not be able to handle this quantity of
   data for performance intensive queries. Moreover, any aspect of
   principled design would be lost when all texts were to be combined;
   we therefore advise choosing one of our pre-selected corpora or
   creating your own selection. `[Go] <cliccorpora.html>`__
